# Supabase PostgreSQL setup

Daily Berlin Jobs uses ordinary PostgreSQL. Supabase is the recommended free
host, while Docker provides the same database locally.

## Local setup

```bash
make setup
make doctor
make dev
```

The default local URL is:

```text
postgresql://daily_jobs:daily_jobs@localhost:5432/daily_berlin_jobs
```

## Supabase project

1. Create a Supabase project in the desired EU region.
2. In **Connect**, copy a session-pooler PostgreSQL URL for GitHub Actions and a
   transaction-pooler URL for Vercel. Replace the password placeholder.
3. Set the session URL locally as `DATABASE_URL` and run:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/db.py migrate
   ```

4. Import the current company catalog once. This command can use the legacy
   Sheet during migration; the crawler no longer needs it afterward:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/db.py import-companies \
     "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_ID/" \
     --input-type sheets --worksheet OneSingle
   ```

   After the initial migration, keep reviewed sources in
   `catalog/companies.yaml` and import them without Google credentials:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/db.py import-companies \
     catalog/companies.yaml --input-type yaml
   ```

5. Optionally backfill the current canonical export. Rows older than 30 days
   are skipped automatically:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/db.py import-jobs data/published_all_jobs.csv
   ```

6. Add `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` to GitHub Actions secrets. Add `DATABASE_URL`
   and `DATABASE_SSL=true` to Vercel. Neither value is public or prefixed with
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

Migration `002_web_reader.sql` creates a `NOLOGIN` role that can select only
`public_jobs`, `daily_jobs`, and `data_status`. In the Supabase SQL editor, give
it a generated password and login capability, then build the corresponding
pooler URL for Vercel:

```sql
ALTER ROLE daily_jobs_web LOGIN PASSWORD 'GENERATE_A_LONG_RANDOM_PASSWORD';
```

Keep the migration/crawler connection in GitHub Actions. Never reuse the
database owner URL in browser-accessible code.

## Daily lifecycle

Each run performs migrations, loads active company sources, crawls jobs,
classifies every row, filters to Berlin engineering roles, and transactionally
upserts the canonical result. The publisher then:

- updates existing rows instead of appending duplicates;
- skips already-expired vacancies;
- deletes full job rows older than 30 days;
- records inserted, updated, skipped, and deleted counts in `crawl_runs`.

The 126 MB raw crawl stays on the GitHub Actions runner and disappears with the
runner. Only the much smaller public subset reaches Supabase.

## Backup and quota policy

Supabase Free does not provide automatic backups. The repository workflow
creates a compressed daily `pg_dump` artifact with 14-day retention. Use the
session/direct connection for backups, not the transaction pooler.

Monitor database size before the free-tier limit becomes operationally risky:

- warning at 350 MB;
- critical at 425 MB;
- investigate unexpected growth in descriptions or fingerprints before 500 MB.

`python scripts/db.py doctor` reports the current database size and marks these
thresholds as healthy, warning, or critical.

Restore testing should be performed periodically in a disposable local
PostgreSQL database:

```bash
gunzip -c daily-berlin-jobs.sql.gz | psql "$RESTORE_DATABASE_URL"
```

## Cutover checklist

- Run the migration and one-time company import.
- Backfill the rolling 30-day job set.
- Use `--storage-backend dual` for three successful crawls.
- Compare counts, canonical URLs, duplicate counts, roles, and
  `classification_version`.
- Point Vercel at PostgreSQL and smoke-test the public page.
- Switch the scheduled workflow to `postgres`.
- Keep the Sheet read-only for a short rollback window, then remove Google
  credentials and the legacy runtime code.
